-------

.. Insert new release notes below this line

* Django 2.1 compatibility - no code changes were required, releasing for PyPI
  trove classifiers and documentation.

2.4.0 (2018-07-31)
------------------

* Added ``JSONArrayAppend`` database function that wraps the respective
  JSON-modifying function from MySQL 5.7.

2.3.1 (2018-07-22)
------------------

* Made ``EnumField`` escape its arguments in a ``pymysql``-friendly fashion.

2.3.0 (2018-06-19)
------------------

* Started testing with MariaDB 10.3.

* Changed ``GlobalStatus.wait_until_load_low()`` to increase the default number
  of allowed running threads from 5 to 10, to account for the new default
  threads in MariaDB 10.3.

* Added ``encoder`` and ``decoder`` arguments to ``JSONField`` for customizing
  the way JSON is encoded and decoded from the database.

* Added a ``touch`` method to the ``MySQLCache`` to refresh cache keys, as
  added in Django 2.1.

* Use a temporary database connection in system checks to avoid application
  startup stalls.

2.2.2 (2018-04-24)
------------------

* Fixed some crashes from ``DynamicField`` instances without explicit ``spec``
  definitions.
* Fixed a crash in system checks for ``ListCharField`` and ``SetCharField``
  instances missing ``max_length``.

2.2.1 (2018-04-14)
------------------

* Fixed ``JSONField.deconstruct()`` to not break the path for subclasses.

2.2.0 (2017-12-04)
------------------

* Add ``output_field`` argument to ``JSONExtract`` function.
* Improved DB version checks for ``JSONField`` and ``DynamicField`` so you can
  have just one connection that supports them.
* Django 2.0 compatibility.

2.1.1 (2017-10-10)
------------------

* Changed subprocess imports for compatibility with Google App Engine.
* (Insert new release notes below this line)
* Made ``MySQLCache.set_many`` return a list as per Django 2.0.

2.1.0 (2017-06-11)
------------------

* Django 1.11 compatibility
* Some fixes to work with new versions of ``mysqlclient``

2.0.0 (2017-05-28)
------------------

* Fixed ``JSONField`` model field string serialization. This is a small
  backwards incompatible change.

  Storing strings mostly used to crash with MySQL error -1 "error totally
  whack", but in the case your string was valid JSON, it would store it as
  a JSON object at the MySQL layer and deserialize it when returned. For
  example you could do this:

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> mymodel.attrs = '{"foo": "bar"}'
      >>> mymodel.save()
      >>> mymodel = MyModel.objects.get(id=mymodel.id)
      >>> mymodel.attrs
      {'foo': 'bar'}

  The new behaviour now correctly returns what you put in:

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> mymodel.attrs
      '{"foo": "bar"}'
* Removed the ``connection.is_mariadb`` monkey patch. This is a small backwards
  incompatible change. Instead of using it, use
  ``django_mysql.utils.connection_is_mariadb``.

1.2.0 (2017-05-14)
------------------

* Only use Django's vendored six (``django.utils.six``). Fixes usage of
  ``EnumField`` and field lookups when ``six`` is not installed as a
  standalone package.
* Added ``JSONInsert``, ``JSONReplace`` and ``JSONSet`` database functions that
  wraps the respective JSON-modifying functions from MySQL 5.7.
* Fixed ``JSONField`` to work with Django's serializer framework, as used in
  e.g. ``dumpdata``.
* Fixed ``JSONField`` form field so that it doesn't overquote inputs when
  redisplaying the form due to invalid user input.

1.1.1 (2017-03-28)
------------------

* Don't allow NaN in ``JSONField`` because MySQL doesn't support it

1.1.0 (2016-07-22)
------------------

* Dropped Django 1.7 support
* Made the query hint functions raise ``RuntimeError`` if you haven't activated
  the query-rewriting layer in settings.

1.0.9 (2016-05-12)
------------------

* Fixed some features to work when there are non-MySQL databases configured
* Fixed ``JSONField`` to allow control characters, which MySQL does - but not
  in a top-level string, only inside a JSON object/array.

1.0.8 (2016-04-08)
------------------

* ``SmartChunkedIterator`` now fails properly for models whose primary key is a
  non-integer foreign key.
* ``pty`` is no longer imported at the top-level in ``django_mysql.utils``,
  fixing Windows compatibility.


1.0.7 (2016-03-04)
------------------

* Added new ``JSONField`` class backed by the JSON type added in MySQL 5.7.
* Added database functions ``JSONExtract``, ``JSONKeys``, and ``JSONLength``
  that wrap the JSON functions added in MySQL 5.7, which can be used with the
  JSON type columns as well as JSON data held in text/varchar columns.
* Added ``If`` database function for simple conditionals.


1.0.6 (2016-02-26)
------------------

* Now MySQL 5.7 compatible
* The final message from ``SmartChunkedIterator`` is now rounded to the nearest
  second.
* ``Lock`` and ``TableLock`` classes now have ``acquire`` and ``release()``
  methods for using them as normal objects rather than context managers

1.0.5 (2016-02-10)
------------------

* Added ``manage.py`` command ``fix_datetime_columns`` that outputs the SQL
  necessary to fix any ``datetime`` columns into ``datetime(6)``, as required
  when upgrading a database to MySQL 5.6+, or MariaDB 5.3+.
* ``SmartChunkedIterator`` output now includes the total time taken and number
  of objects iterated over in the final message.


1.0.4 (2016-02-02)
------------------

* Fixed the new system checks to actually work


1.0.3 (2016-02-02)
------------------

* Fixed ``EnumField`` so that it works properly with forms, and does not accept
  the ``max_length`` argument.
* ``SmartChunkedIterator`` output has been fixed for reversed iteration, and
  now includes a time estimate.
* Added three system checks that give warnings if the MySQL configuration can
  (probably) be improved.


1.0.2 (2016-01-24)
------------------

* New function ``add_QuerySetMixin`` allows addding the ``QuerySetMixin`` to
  arbitrary ``QuerySet``\s, for when you can't edit a model class.
* Added field class ``EnumField`` that uses MySQL's ``ENUM`` data type.

1.0.1 (2015-11-18)
------------------

* Added ``chunk_min`` argument to ``SmartChunkedIterator``

1.0.0 (2015-10-29)
------------------

* Changed version number to 1.0.0 to indicate maturity.
* Added ``DynamicField`` for using MariaDB's Named Dynamic Columns, and related
  database functions ``ColumnAdd``, ``ColumnDelete``, and ``ColumnGet``.
* ``SmartChunkedIterator`` with ``report_progress=True`` correctly reports
  'lowest pk so far' when iterating in reverse.
* Fix broken import paths during ``deconstruct()`` for subclasses of all
  fields: ``ListCharField``, ``ListTextField``, ``SetCharField``,
  ``SetTextField``, ``SizedBinaryField`` and ``SizedTextField``
* Added XML database functions - ``UpdateXML`` and ``XMLExtractValue``.

0.2.3 (2015-10-12)
------------------

* Allow ``approx_count`` on QuerySets for which only query hints have been used
* Added index query hints to ``QuerySet`` methods, via query-rewriting layer
* Added ``ordering`` parameter to ``GroupConcat`` to specify the ``ORDER BY``
  clause
* Added index query hints to ``QuerySet`` methods, via query-rewriting layer
* Added ``sql_calc_found_rows()`` query hint that calculates the total rows
  that match when you only take a slice, which becomes available on the
  ``found_rows`` attribute
* Made ``SmartChunkedIterator`` work with ``reverse()``'d ``QuerySet``\s

0.2.2 (2015-09-03)
------------------

* ``SmartChunkedIterator`` now takes an argument ``chunk_size`` as the initial
  chunk size
* ``SmartChunkedIterator`` now allows models whose primary key is a
  ``ForeignKey``
* Added ``iter_smart_pk_ranges`` which is similar to ``iter_smart_chunks`` but
  yields only the start and end primary keys for each chunks, in a tuple.
* Added prefix methods to ``MySQLCache`` - ``delete_with_prefix``,
  ``get_with_prefix``, ``keys_with_prefix``
* Added ``Bit1BooleanField`` and ``NullBit1BooleanField`` model fields that
  work with boolean fields built by other databases that use the ``BIT(1)``
  column type

------------------

* Added Regexp database functions for MariaDB - ``RegexpInstr``,
  ``RegexpReplace``, and ``RegexpSubstr``
* Added the option to not limit the size of a ``MySQLCache`` by setting
  ``MAX_ENTRIES`` = -1.
* ``MySQLCache`` performance improvements in `get`, `get_many`, and `has_key`
* Added query-rewriting layer added which allows the use of MySQL query hints
  such as ``STRAIGHT_JOIN`` via QuerySet methods, as well as adding label
  comments to track where queries are generated.

  ``TextField``
* Migration operations added - ``InstallPlugin``, ``InstallSOName``, and
  ``AlterStorageEngine``
* Extra ORM aggregates added - ``BitAnd``, ``BitOr``, and ``BitXor``
* ``MySQLCache`` is now case-sensitive. If you are already using it, an upgrade
  ``ALTER TABLE`` and migration is provided at `the end of the cache docs
  <https://django-mysql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cache.html>`_.
* (MariaDB only) The ``Lock`` class gained a class method ``held_with_prefix``
  to query held locks matching a given prefix
* ``SmartIterator`` bugfix for chunks with 0 objects slowing iteration; they
  such chunks most often occur on tables with primary key "holes"
* Now tested against Django master for cutting edge users and forwards
  compatibility
