A MySQL-specific backend for Django's cache framework.


MySQLCache
==========

An efficient cache backend using a MySQL table, an alternative to Django's
database-agnostic ``DatabaseCache``. It has the following advantages:

* Each operation uses only one query, including the ``*_many`` methods. This is
  unlike ``DatabaseCache`` which uses multiple queries for nearly every
  operation.
* Automatic client-side ``zlib`` compression for objects larger than a given
  threshold. It is also easy to subclass and add your own serialization or
  compression schemes.
* Faster probabilistic culling behaviour during write operations, which you can
  also turn off and execute in a background task. This can be a bottleneck with
  Django's ``DatabaseCache`` since it culls on every write operation, executing
  a ``SELECT COUNT(*)`` which requires a full table scan.
* Integer counters with atomic ``incr()`` and ``decr()`` operations, like the
  ``MemcachedCache`` backend.

Usage
-----

To use, add an entry to your ``CACHES`` setting with:

* ``BACKEND`` set to ``django_mysql.cache.MySQLCache``

* ``LOCATION`` set to ``tablename``, the name of the table to use. This name
  can be whatever you want, as long as it's a valid table name that's not
  already being used in your database.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    CACHES = {
        "default": {
            "BACKEND": "django_mysql.cache.MySQLCache",
            "LOCATION": "my_super_cache",
        }
    }

You then need to make the table. The schema is *not* compatible with that of
``DatabaseCache``, so if you are switching, you will need to create a fresh
table.

Use the management command ``mysql_cache_migration`` to output a migration that
creates tables for all the ``MySQLCache`` instances you have configured. For
example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python manage.py mysql_cache_migration
    from django.db import migrations


    class Migration(migrations.Migration):

        dependencies = [
            # Add a dependency in here on an existing migration in the app you
            # put this migration in, for example:
            # ('myapp', '0001_initial'),
        ]

        operations = [
            migrations.RunSQL(
                """
                CREATE TABLE `my_super_cache` (
                    cache_key varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin
                                           NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
                    value longblob NOT NULL,
                    value_type char(1) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin
                                       NOT NULL DEFAULT 'p',
                    expires BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL
                );
                """,
                "DROP TABLE `my_super_cache`"
            ),
        ]



Save this to a file in the ``migrations`` directory of one of your project's
apps, and add one of your existing migrations to the file's ``dependencies``.
You might want to customize the SQL at this time, for example switching the
table to use the ``MEMORY`` storage engine.

Django requires you to install
`sqlparse <https://pypi.org/project/sqlparse/>`_
to run the ``RunSQL`` operation in the migration, so make sure it is installed.

Once the migration has run, the cache is ready to work!


Multiple Databases
------------------

If you use this with multiple databases, you'll also need to set up routing
instructions for the cache table. This can be done with the same method
that is described for ``DatabaseCache`` in the `Django manual
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/cache/#database-caching>`__, apart
from the application name is ``django_mysql``.

.. note::

    Even if you aren't using multiple MySQL databases, it may be worth using
    routing anyway to put all your cache operations on a second connection -
    this way they won't be affected by transactions your main code runs.


Extra Details
-------------

``MySQLCache`` is fully compatible with Django's cache API, but it also extends
it and there are, of course, a few details to be aware of.


incr/decr
~~~~~~~~~

Like ``MemcachedCache`` (and unlike ``DatabaseCache``), ``incr`` and ``decr``
are atomic operations, and can only be used with ``int`` values. They have the
range of MySQL's ``SIGNED BIGINT`` (-9223372036854775808 to
9223372036854775807).


max_allowed_packet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MySQL has a setting called ``max_allowed_packet``, which is the maximum size of
a query, including data. This therefore constrains the size of a cached value,
but you're more likely to run up against it first with the
``get_many``/``set_many`` operations.

`The MySQL 5.5 default <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-system-
variables.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet>`_ is 1 MB, and `the MySQL 5.6 default
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/server-system-
variables.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet>`_ is 4MB, with which most
applications will be fine. You can tweak it as high as 1GB (if this isn't
enough, you should probably be considering another solution!).


culling
~~~~~~~

MySQL is designed to store data forever, and thus doesn't have a direct way of
setting expired rows to disappear. The expiration of old keys and the limiting
of rows to ``MAX_ENTRIES`` is therefore performed in the cache backend by
performing a cull operation when appropriate. This deletes expired keys first,
then if more than ``MAX_ENTRIES`` keys remain, it deletes 1 /
``CULL_FREQUENCY`` of them. The options and strategy are described in in more
detail in the `Django manual
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/cache/#cache-arguments>`_.

Django's ``DatabaseCache`` performs a cull check on *every* write operation.
This runs a ``SELECT COUNT(*)`` on the table, which means a full-table scan.
Naturally, this takes a bit of time and becomes a bottleneck for medium or
large cache table sizes of caching. ``MySQLCache`` helps you solve this in two
ways:

1. The cull-on-write behaviour is probabilistic, by default running on 1% of
   writes. This is set with the ``CULL_PROBABILITY`` option, which should be a
   number between 0 and 1. For example, if you want to use the same
   cull-on-*every*-write behaviour as used by ``DatabaseCache`` (you probably
   don't), set ``CULL_PROBABILITY`` to 1.0:

   .. code-block:: python

       CACHES = {
           "default": {
               "BACKEND": "django_mysql.cache.MySQLCache",
               "LOCATION": "some_table_name",
               "OPTIONS": {"CULL_PROBABILITY": 1.0},
           }
       }

2. The ``cull()`` method is available as a public method so you can set up your
   own culling schedule in background processing, never affecting any
   user-facing web requests. Set ``CULL_PROBABILITY`` to 0, and then set up
   your task. For example, if you are using **celery** you could use a task
   like this:

   .. code-block:: python

       @shared_task
       def clear_caches():
           caches["default"].cull()
           caches["other_cache"].cull()

   This functionality is also available as the management command
   ``cull_mysql_caches``, which you might run as a cron job. It performs
   ``cull()`` on all of your ``MySQLCache`` instances, or you can give it names
   to just cull those. For example, this:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ python manage.py cull_mysql_caches default other_cache

   ...will call ``caches['default'].cull()`` and
   ``caches['other_cache'].cull()``.

You can also disable the ``MAX_ENTRIES`` behaviour, which avoids the ``SELECT
COUNT(*)`` entirely, and makes ``cull()`` only delete expired keys. To do this,
set ``MAX_ENTRIES`` to -1:

.. code-block:: python

    CACHES = {
        "default": {
            "BACKEND": "django_mysql.cache.MySQLCache",
            "LOCATION": "some_table_name",
            "OPTIONS": {"MAX_ENTRIES": -1},
        }
    }

Note that you should then of course monitor the size of your cache table well,
since it has no bounds on its growth.

compression
~~~~~~~~~~~

Like the other Django cache backends, stored objects are serialized with
``pickle`` (except from integers, which are stored as integers so that the
``incr()`` and ``decr()`` operations will work). If pickled data has has a size
in bytes equal to or greater than the threshold defined by the option
``COMPRESS_MIN_LENGTH``, it will be compressed with ``zlib`` in Python before
being stored, reducing the on-disk size in MySQL and network costs for storage
and retrieval. The zlib level is set by the option ``COMPRESS_LEVEL``.

``COMPRESS_MIN_LENGTH`` defaults to 5000, and ``COMPRESS_LEVEL`` defaults to
the ``zlib`` default of 6. You can tune these options - for example, to
compress all objects >= 100 bytes at the maximum level of 9, pass the options
like so:

.. code-block:: python

    CACHES = {
        "default": {
            "BACKEND": "django_mysql.cache.MySQLCache",
            "LOCATION": "some_table_name",
            "OPTIONS": {"COMPRESS_MIN_LENGTH": 100, "COMPRESS_LEVEL": 9},
        }
    }

To turn compression off, set ``COMPRESS_MIN_LENGTH`` to 0. The options only
affect new writes - any compressed values already in the table will remain
readable.


custom serialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can implement your own serialization by subclassing ``MySQLCache``. It uses
two methods that you should override.

Values are stored in the table with two columns - ``value``, which is the blob
of binary data, and ``value_type``, a single latin1 character that specifies
the type of data in ``value``. MySQLCache by default uses three codes for
``value_type``:

* ``i`` - The blob is an integer. This is used so that counters can be
  deserialized by MySQL during the atomic ``incr()`` and ``decr()`` operations.
* ``p`` - The blob is a pickled Python object.
* ``z`` - The blob is a zlib-compressed pickled Python object.

For future compatibility, ``MySQLCache`` reserves all lower-case letters. For
custom types you can use upper-case letters.

The methods you need to override (and probably call ``super()`` from) are:

.. method:: encode(obj)

    Takes an object and returns a tuple ``(value, value_type)``, ready to be
    inserted as parameters into the SQL query.

.. method:: decode(value, value_type)

    Takes the pair of ``(value, value_type)`` as stored in the table and
    returns the deserialized object.

Studying the source of ``MySQLCache`` will probably give you the best way to
extend these methods for your use case.


prefix methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three extension methods are available to work with sets of keys sharing a
common prefix. Whilst these would not be efficient on other cache backends such
as memcached, in an InnoDB table the keys are stored in order so range scans
are easy.

To use these methods, it must be possible to reverse-map the "full" key stored
in the databse to the key you would provide to ``cache.get``, via a 'reverse
key function'. If you have not set ``KEY_FUNCTION``, ``MySQLCache`` will use
Django’s default key function, and can therefore default the reverse key
function too, so you will not need to add anything.

However, if you have set ``KEY_FUNCTION``, you will also need to supply
``REVERSE_KEY_FUNCTION`` before the prefix methods can work. For example,
with a simple custom key function that ignores ``key_prefix`` and ``version``,
you might do this:

.. code-block:: python

    def my_key_func(key, key_prefix, version):
        return key  # Ignore key_prefix and version


    def my_reverse_key_func(full_key):
        # key_prefix and version still need to be returned
        key_prefix = None
        version = None
        return key, key_prefix, version


    CACHES = {
        "default": {
            "BACKEND": "django_mysql.cache.MySQLCache",
            "LOCATION": "some_table_name",
            "KEY_FUNCTION": my_key_func,
            "REVERSE_KEY_FUNCTION": my_reverse_key_func,
        }
    }

Once you’re set up, the following prefix methods can be used:

.. method:: delete_with_prefix(prefix, version=None)

    Deletes all keys that start with the string ``prefix``. If ``version`` is
    not provided, it will default to the ``VERSION`` setting. Returns the
    number of keys that were deleted. For example:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> cache.set_many({"Car1": "Blue", "Car4": "Red", "Truck3": "Yellow"})
        >>> cache.delete_with_prefix("Truck")
        1
        >>> cache.get("Truck3")
        None

    .. note::

        This method does not require you to set the reverse key function.

.. method:: get_with_prefix(prefix, version=None)

    Like ``get_many``, returns a dict of key to value for all keys that start
    with the string ``prefix``. If ``version`` is not provided, it will default
    to the ``VERSION`` setting. For example:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> cache.set_many({"Car1": "Blue", "Car4": "Red", "Truck3": "Yellow"})
        >>> cache.get_with_prefix("Truck")
        {'Truck3': 'Yellow'}
        >>> cache.get_with_prefix("Ca")
        {'Car1': 'Blue', 'Car4': 'Red'}
        >>> cache.get_with_prefix("")
        {'Car1': 'Blue', 'Car4': 'Red', 'Truck3': 'Yellow'}

.. method:: keys_with_prefix(prefix, version=None)

    Returns a set of all the keys that start with the string ``prefix``. If
    ``version`` is not provided, it will default to the ``VERSION`` setting.
    For example:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> cache.set_many({"Car1": "Blue", "Car4": "Red", "Truck3": "Yellow"})
        >>> cache.keys_with_prefix("Car")
        set(['Car1', 'Car2'])


Changes
-------

Versions 0.1.10 -> 0.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initially, in Django-MySQL version 0.1.10, ``MySQLCache`` did not force the
columns to use case sensitive collations; in version 0.2.0 this was fixed. You
can upgrade by adding a migration with the following SQL, if you replace
``yourtablename``:

.. code-block:: mysql

    ALTER TABLE yourtablename
        MODIFY cache_key varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin
                                      NOT NULL,
        MODIFY value_type char(1) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin
                                  NOT NULL DEFAULT 'p';

Or as a reversible migration:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import migrations


    class Migration(migrations.Migration):

        dependencies = []

        operations = [
            migrations.RunSQL(
                """
                ALTER TABLE yourtablename
                    MODIFY cache_key varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin
                                                  NOT NULL,
                    MODIFY value_type char(1) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin
                                              NOT NULL DEFAULT 'p'
                """,
                """
                ALTER TABLE yourtablename
                    MODIFY cache_key varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 NOT NULL,
                    MODIFY value_type char(1) CHARACTER SET latin1 NOT NULL DEFAULT 'p'
                """,
            )
        ]
