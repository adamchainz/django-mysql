Migration Operations
====================

.. currentmodule:: django_mysql.operations

MySQL-specific `migration operations
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/migration-operations/>`_
that can all be imported from ``django_mysql.operations``.


Install Plugin
--------------

.. class:: InstallPlugin(name, soname)

    An ``Operation`` subclass that installs a MySQL plugin. Runs
    ``INSTALL PLUGIN name SONAME soname``, but does a check to see if the
    plugin is already installed to make it more idempotent.

    Docs:
    `MySQL <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/install-plugin.html>`__ /
    `MariaDB <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/install-plugin/>`__.

    .. attribute:: name

        This is a required argument. The name of the plugin to install.

    .. attribute:: soname

        This is a required argument. The name of the library to install the
        plugin from. Note that on MySQL you must include the extension (e.g.
        ``.so``, ``.dll``) whilst on MariaDB you may skip it to keep the
        operation platform-independent.

    Example usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        from django.db import migrations
        from django_mysql.operations import InstallPlugin


        class Migration(migrations.Migration):

            dependencies = []

            operations = [
                # Install https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/metadata_lock_info/
                InstallPlugin("metadata_lock_info", "metadata_lock_info.so")
            ]



Install SOName
--------------

.. class:: InstallSOName(soname)

    **MariaDB** only.

    An ``Operation`` subclass that installs a MariaDB plugin library. One
    library may contain multiple plugins that work together, this installs all
    of the plugins in the named library file. Runs ``INSTALL SONAME soname``.
    Note that unlike ``InstallPlugin``, there is no idempotency check to see if
    the library is already installed, since there is no way of knowing if all
    the plugins inside the library are installed.

    Docs: `MariaDB <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/install-soname/>`_.

    .. attribute:: soname

        This is a required argument. The name of the library to install the
        plugin from. You may skip the file extension (e.g. ``.so``, ``.dll``)
        to keep the operation platform-independent.

    Example usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        from django.db import migrations
        from django_mysql.operations import InstallSOName


        class Migration(migrations.Migration):

            dependencies = []

            operations = [
                # Install https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/metadata_lock_info/
                InstallSOName("metadata_lock_info")
            ]


Alter Storage Engine
--------------------

.. class:: AlterStorageEngine(name, to_engine, from_engine=None)

    An ``Operation`` subclass that alters the model's table's storage engine.
    Because Django has no knowledge of storage engines, you must provide the
    previous storage engine for the operation to be reversible.

    .. attribute:: name

        This is a required argument. The name of the model to alter.

    .. attribute:: to_engine

        This is a required argument. The storage engine to move the model to.

    .. attribute:: from_engine

        This is an optional argument. The storage engine the model is moving
        from. If you do not provide this, the operation is not reversible.

    .. note::

        If you're using this to move from MyISAM to InnoDB, there's a page for
        you in the MariaDB knowledge base - `Converting Tables from MyISAM to
        InnoDB
        <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/converting-tables-from-myisam-to-innodb/>`_.

    Example usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        from django.db import migrations
        from django_mysql.operations import AlterStorageEngine


        class Migration(migrations.Migration):

            dependencies = []

            operations = [AlterStorageEngine("Pony", from_engine="MyISAM", to_engine="InnoDB")]
